#Why this repo?

I don't have a facebook account and I wanted to see my friend's pics because she asked me to check some drawings. I was browsing the pages and an annoying message asking me to login didn't let me see the 4 pics I wanted to see. So I wanted to get rid of this message.

#How can I use the extension too?

* Browse to chrome:extensions
* Enable the dev mode
* Add the extension
